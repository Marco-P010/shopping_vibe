# Simple Online Shop

## 🛍️ Overview

This is a **simple and responsive online shopping website** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, adjust quantities, and simulate checkout — all stored locally using **LocalStorage**.

The design features a clean, modern interface with a responsive product grid, hero section, and an interactive cart page.
